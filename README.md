# Milestone Project 3: Book Tracker


## Description

This project includes a full-scale application that allows users to create an account to keep track of books they're reading. Through the Google Books API, users are able to search and view book details and add them to their personal book list. 

### Background

This book tracker application was submitted as the final project for our Software Development Bootcamp. The assignment was to create and deploy an application showcasing all of our skills learned throughout the program. 

### Challenges & Solutions

This was the initial outline created to guide the build of the Book Tracker application.

- Social engagement like commmenting and following other user profiles
- Reading goal tracker with badges or other rewards for streaks
